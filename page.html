    Beam olympics is a competition when you can prove your knowledge of Elixir (or Erlang) and programming skills in general.
    If you would like to join the game you have to have Erlang or Elixir or docker installed on your machine.
    You will play through an IEx (erl) session, server'll send you a task and you'll answer with a solution.
</p>

<!-- 
<div class="funky-text">
    <h1><span class='char0'>H</span><span class='char1'>o</span><span class='char2'>w</span><span class='char3'> </span><span class='char4'>T</span><span class='char5'>o</span><span class='char6'> </span><span class='char7'>P</span><span class='char8'>l</span><span class='char9'>a</span><span class='char10'>y</span><span class='char11'></span></h1>
</div>
-->

<p>If you meet the above requirement just come near Erlang Solution stand and
    connect to the <strong>BeamChallenge</strong> WiFi network
    (password <strong>ilovebeam</strong>) and go to
    <a href="http://192.168.88.230:4000/how-to-play"><b>http://192.168.88.230:4000/how-to-play</b></a> for detailed instructions.</p>


<!--
<p>We encourage you to run an IEx inside a docker container for security reasons.</p>
<pre>$ docker run -it --rm -h elixir.local elixir:1.5.3-slim iex --name 50306@192.168.88.235 --cookie beam</pre>
<p>But if you are breave enough you can run an IEx directly on your machine.</p>
<pre>$ iex --name 50306@192.168.88.235 --cookie beam</pre>
<p>Then just connect to the server.</p>
<pre>
iex> Node.connect :"olympics@192.168.88.230"
true</pre>

<p>Now you can signup a new user by running</p>

<pre>iex> GenServer.call({:bo_server, :"olympics@192.168.88.230"}, {:signup, "joe"}) </pre>

<p>You can fetch the current task with</p>

<pre>iex> GenServer.call({:bo_server, :"olympics@192.168.88.230"}, {:task, "joe"}) </pre>

<p>When you're done, you can submit your solution</p>

<pre>iex> GenServer.call({:bo_server, :"olympics@192.168.88.230"}, {:submit, "joe", fn() -> :k end})</pre>

<p>If you get stuck and want to skip the current task</p>

<pre>iex> GenServer.call({:bo_server, :"olympics@192.168.88.230"}, {:skip, "joe"}) </pre>

<p>And if you want to check your current score</p>

<pre>iex> GenServer.call({:bo_server, :"olympics@192.168.88.230"}, {:score, "joe"}) </pre>
-->

<p>You will be able to play at any time during the first day of the conference.
The challenges are aimed at beginner to intermediate level developers, and each
one takes only a few minutes to solve.</p>

<p>You can check the leaderboard and scores at the Erlang Solutions table at
any time. At the end of the conference, the player with the highest score will
win (TODO: change this part >) the Amazon Echo. In case a tie should occur, a draw will be conducted to
select the prize winner.</p>

<p>May the best Alchemist win!</p>

<ul>
  <li>To prevent fraud, you must always post solutions from the node where you signed up.</li>
  <li>There is no undo, so if you skipped a task you can't choose to submit a solution for it later.</li>
  <li>Each task has its own score. If you solve a task correctly, you get full points. If you skip a task, you lose half of that task points.</li>
