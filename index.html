                        Welcome to the BEAM Challenge! Compete with your peers to test your
                        knowledge of Elixir or Erlang and the programming skills in general.
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        If you would like to join the game you must have Erlang or Elixir,
                        or docker installed on your machine. You will play through an IEx (erl) session,
                        the server will send you a task and you'll answer with a solution.
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        If you meet the above requirement just come near the Erlang Solutions stand
                        and connect to the <strong>BeamChallenge</strong> WiFi network (password: <strong>ilovebeam</strong>).
                        The instructions on how to play our game can be found here:

                        BEAM Challenge is going to be run throughout 2018 to connect with our global community
                        and to celebrate 20 years of open sourced Erlang together. Join us and be part of
                        the #OpenErlang celebration!
                    </p>

                        of the conference. The challenges are aimed at beginner to intermediate level developers,
                        and each one takes only a few minutes to solve.
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        You can check the leaderboard and scores at the Erlang Solutions table at any time.
                        The player with the highest score will be rewarded with an Amazon Gift Voucher of £65.
                        In case a tie should occur, a draw will be conducted to select the prize winner.
                    </p>

                        <li>To prevent fraud, you must always post solutions from the node where you signed up.</li>
                        <li>There is no undo, so if you skipped a task you can't choose to submit a solution for it later.</li>
                        <li>Each task has its own score. If you solve a task correctly, you get full points. If you skip a task, you lose half of that task’s points.</li>
